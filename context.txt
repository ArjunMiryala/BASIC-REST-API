REST API
representational state transfer application programming interface
this rest api from tech with tim's video may not have all the features but it is a start to my learning of API specifically REST api
REST api is way for other programms or applications to manuplate or update information, way to deal with data in structered format
we are building kinda mock YOUTUBE api, gonna deal with channel,videos, views and stuff. does not have all the features of YOUTUBE
we will be creating an api for create,delete,update videos and link those videos to the channels
